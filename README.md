# DataStructures_Algorithms
This repository is my implementation of some Data Structures and Algorithms by C++ and Python. 

Its more like the diary of my self-learning about DSA. 🤗

I like to learn things the most relaxed way, i will spend my free time to update this. 

Don't force to learn all the things so quickly. Slowly but surely.

In folders, i will try to add the explanation for clearly understanding. 💪 😘
